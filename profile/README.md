# JSOBF
JSobf is a proof of concept obfuscation tool designed for JavaScript code optimization and obfuscation, leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance its capabilities. The tool employs intra-procedural passes, each tailored to reshape the code in a way that minimizes the impact on both time and space complexity. By utilizing the power of Wasm, we can achieve a significant strength in obfuscation while maintaining a stable execution time.

It's essential to note that JSobf is still a work in progress, representing a proof of concept that I've been actively developing for some time. During the development process, I've identified some significant issues related to parameter injection that need to be addressed.
