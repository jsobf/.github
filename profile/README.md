# JSobf
###### JSobf is a proof-of-concept obfuscation tool designed for JavaScript code optimization and obfuscation, leveraging WebAssembly (Wasm) to enhance its capabilities. The tool employs intra-procedural passes, each tailored to reshape the code in a way that minimizes the impact on both time and space complexity. By utilizing the power of Wasm, we can achieve significant strength in obfuscation while maintaining a stable execution time.

##### It's essential to note that JSobf is still a WIP, and that it's missing critical features and has problems that need fixing.
